# newTab
It will change your start page for a new one with:
* several useful links
* searchbox that searchs on google, MDN, duckduckgo or stackoverflow
* changes it background each time you open the browser

It was based on https://extensionizr.com but I wanted to use some npm packages, so I ended up using webpack to wrap it up. 

Since it not in chrome store (yet), in order to install it you must download, build and import as a unpacked extension.
